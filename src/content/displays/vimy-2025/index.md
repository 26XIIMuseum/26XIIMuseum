## FOMI President’s Greeting - Sandra Armstrong


The Friends of the Museum thank you for attending our Victory ’45 fundraising evening. We are currently experiencing a renewed wave of patriotism in Canada.

Tonight, we hope to reflect the celebrations of 80 years ago when victory bells rang through the streets, the towns, and the cities of Canada.

We appreciate all who attend this evening’s celebrations. Thank you for supporting the museum throughout the year.
